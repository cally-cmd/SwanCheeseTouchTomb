# SwanCheeseTouchTomb

## Title

The title of our game is `Ducking the Cheese`!

## Intent

Our intent for making this game is to further improve on the skills that we have been developing in the first, second, and third games while also adding additional functionality, complexity, and aestheticism. We intend to have a fully realized game with necessary menus, looks, sounds, and length.

## Narrative

Here you will play as a swan named Robin. You are in possession of a rare and IMMENSELY delicious piece of cheese! The ducks in the park you frequent and simply pecking at your heels trying to take it from you, and if you fly away then the cheese will fall out of your wings. To escape the clutches of the demented ducks you must follow the mazes that lead out of the park!

## Mechanics

To move Robin use WASD or the arrow keys! The goal to each maze is highlighted by small particles. If the ducks collide with the player then the level restarts!

## Aesthetics

Since the player sprite is a swan and the enemies are ducks, we decided to go with a more floral and park themed tilemap to match. From here we needed a proper background that continued the floral theme along with some font that looked simple with a dash of whimsy. The music was then chosen to give the ambience of a park, not too much tension, just a relaxing tune.

## Joys and Struggles

This biggest joys will always be when something performs as we expect it to! And this occurs mostly with the objects that we are already occustomed to using like the particle system, the tilemap, the prefabs, and triggers. This project felt much the same way. There were some strong struggles though! Our biggest struggles this time were the clean screen transitions and getting the AI to steer and navigate as we intended!

## Contributions

Daniel found or made the assets that were used for the game: audio, background, font, tilemap, and sprite map. He also added the particle system, trail system, and directionality for sprites. He added the information for the credits, help, and partially the end screen. He created the mazes and each of the maps. Rhett programmed the player and camera movement as well as the AI Steering script for the game. Justin added all of the buttons, scene transitions, level changes, sound effects, and dialog boxes.
